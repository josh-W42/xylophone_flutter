# xylophone_music_app

A simple flutter app built for learning

## Description:

In this app there are 7 keys to press and when pressed they each play a different note on a
xylophone.

The goals of this project were to:
- Understand how to use download and use flutter plugins to accomplish a complex task.
- Use local asset files to play audio during a user interaction.
- Better my understanding how dart functions and their variations.
